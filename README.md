# Telecom Call Data Engineering Pipeline (PySpark)

A complete **Telecom Call Detail Records (CDR) Data Engineering Pipeline** built using **PySpark** and the modern **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**.

This project processes raw telecom call transaction data from CSV, cleans and transforms it into Parquet format, applies anomaly detection rules, builds a Star Schema model, and generates business KPIs for telecom analytics.

It is designed as a **portfolio-quality Data Engineering project** demonstrating real-world ETL workflows, scalable lakehouse design, and analytics-ready outputs.
