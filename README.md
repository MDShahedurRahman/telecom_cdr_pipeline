# Telecom Call Data Engineering Pipeline (PySpark)

A complete **Telecom Call Detail Records (CDR) Data Engineering Pipeline** built using **PySpark** and the modern **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**.

This project processes raw telecom call transaction data from CSV, cleans and transforms it into Parquet format, applies anomaly detection rules, builds a Star Schema model, and generates business KPIs for telecom analytics.

It is designed as a **portfolio-quality Data Engineering project** demonstrating real-world ETL workflows, scalable lakehouse design, and analytics-ready outputs.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Telecom companies generate billions of call records daily.  
These records are used for:

- Revenue reporting  
- Customer usage analytics  
- Fraud and anomaly detection  
- Operational monitoring  

Raw call transaction data must be transformed into structured, analytics-ready datasets.

This pipeline performs:

- Raw data ingestion into a Data Lake (Bronze)
- Data cleaning and standardization (Silver)
- Call anomaly detection (Long calls, International calls)
- Star Schema modeling for analytics (Gold)
- Business KPI queries for insights
